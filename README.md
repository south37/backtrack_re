## BacktrckRe
Simple ruby implementation of backtracking regular expression engine.

### Feature
- Only supports `^`, `.`, `*`, `$` as meta characters.

### Thanks
- This implementation is highly inspired by [Rob pike's implementation](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr09/cos333/beautiful.html).
